pyatoms - a simple Python package for manipulating XYZ files

James Kermode <james.kermode@gmail.com>

I've written a simple Python packaged called PyAtoms for playing with
atomic configurations interactively. It works with the extended XYZ
file format, and can also write files in AtomEye CFG format, and read
CASTEP .cell and .geom files.

Requirements
------------

1. Python 2.4 or later - available from www.python.org
2. NumPy 1.0.1 or later - available from www.numpy.org

Optionally ipython (http://ipython.scipy.org) will make playing with
python more enjoyable and productive.


Installation
------------

First verify that numpy is installed correctly by running python and
entering the command

>>> import numpy

If all is well there will be no error messages. Then change to the
pyatoms source directory and run

python setup.py install

to install in the default location for this python version

python setup.py install --home=${HOME}

to install into your home directory.

You can then verify that everything is okay with the following python
command:

>>> import pyatoms


Usage Example
-------------

Here's an example of a python console session using the Atoms and AtomEye modules:

from pyatoms import *         # Load PyAtoms modules

a = Atoms('filepot.xyz')      # Load from an extended XYZ file

a.add_property('norm2_pos',norm2(a.pos))

a.write_xyz('out.xyz') # Write it to a new file

print count(a.pos[:,1] < 0)   # How many atoms with x < 0?

b = a.filter(a.pos[:,0] < 0)  # Make a new atoms object 
                              # containing just these atoms

as = [a for a in frame_reader('movie.xyz')] # Load a list of Atoms

from pyatoms.atomeye import * # Load the AtomEye module

ae = AtomEye()              # Initialise from a list of Atoms
ae.view(as[0],align='CoM')  # Show first frame, centre on centre of mass
ae.animate(as)              # Animate configs from list
